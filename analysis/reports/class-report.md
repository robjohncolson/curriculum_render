## Item Analysis Snapshot

| Question | Difficulty | p-value | Discrimination | Top Distractor |
|----------|------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| U1-L10-Q01 | Easy | 80% | 0.23 | B (20%) |
| U1-L10-Q02 | Medium | 67% | 0.82 | B (33%) |
| U1-L10-Q03 | Medium | 67% | 0.52 | D (22%) |
| U1-L10-Q05 | Easy | 89% | 0.26 | C (11%) |
| U1-L10-Q07 | Easy | 71% | 0.79 | A (14%) |
| U1-L10-Q08 | Easy | 71% | 0.79 | D (14%) |

## Key Insights

### Strongest Item
**U1-L10-Q02** has the highest discrimination (0.825), making it the best differentiator between high and low performers.

### Items Needing Review
- **U1-L10-Q01:** Low discrimination (0.23) - too easy (80% correct)
- **U1-L10-Q05:** Low discrimination (0.26) - too easy (89% correct)

## Top Misconceptions

### 1. 1. U1-L10-Q02

**What students chose:** Selected B instead of A

**Frequency:** 33% (3 students)

**Evidence:** 3 students (33%) selected B instead of A

**Teaching Note:** This indicates confusion about z-score to proportion conversion. Students likely misunderstand how to use the normal table or confuse the z-score value with the proportion.

**Recommended Action:** Mini-lesson on Table A usage, emphasizing that the table value IS the proportion below for a given z-score.

### 2. 2. U1-L10-Q03

**What students chose:** Selected D instead of A

**Frequency:** 22% (2 students)

**Evidence:** 2 students (22%) selected D instead of A

**Teaching Note:** Students may struggle with extreme value probabilities or tail areas of the normal distribution.

### 3. 3. U1-L10-Q01

**What students chose:** Selected B instead of D

**Frequency:** 20% (2 students)

**Evidence:** 2 students (20%) selected B instead of D

**Teaching Note:** Review fundamental concepts and provide targeted practice.

## Weak Skills (Unit 1 Overall)

Based on performance across all Unit 1 lessons:

- **Distribution Shape:** 3/3 students struggling (100%)
- **Measures of Center:** 27/27 students struggling (100%)
- **Measures of Spread:** 21/21 students struggling (100%)
- **Statistical Displays:** 28/28 students struggling (100%)
- **Comparing Distributions:** 19/19 students struggling (100%)

## Recommended Mini-Lessons

### 1. Z-Score to Proportion Conversion (Q02 Misconception)
**Duration:** 12 minutes

**Objectives:**
- Correctly use Table A to find proportions
- Distinguish "below" (use table directly) from "above" (subtract from 1)

**Materials:** Normal table, practice problems

**See:** `interventions/mini-lesson-Q02.md` for complete lesson plan

### 2. CR Completion Blitz (Low Response Rates)
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes

**Objectives:**
- Complete missing Q04 (histogram) and Q06 (z-scores) responses
- Build CR confidence

**See:** `interventions/CR-blitz-plan.md` for implementation

### 3. Distribution Shape Review
**Rationale:** 100% of students struggling across Unit 1

**Suggested Activities:**
- Reteach core concepts with new examples
- Pair work with mixed-ability partners
- Formative exit ticket to assess improvement

## Exit Ticket Bank

### Quick Check: Normal Distribution (5 mins)
1. Calculate the z-score for x = 52 given Î¼ = 48, Ïƒ = 2
2. What proportion of values fall below z = 1.5?
3. Interpret your answer to #2 in context

### Quick Check: Distribution Description (5 mins)
1. Describe the shape of this distribution: [provide histogram]
2. Estimate the center
3. Would mean or median be higher? Why?

**Full exit ticket questions available in:** `interventions/exit-ticket-Q02.csv`

## Students Needing Support

### Priority (Red - <60%)
- **Janelle** (mango_panda)
  - See: `reports/students/mango_panda-brief.md` for personalized plan
- **Gabriella** (guava_cat)
  - See: `reports/students/guava_cat-brief.md` for personalized plan

### Monitor (Yellow - 60-79%)
- **Hazel** (apple_rabbit)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **This Week:**
   - Run CR Blitz to collect missing Q04/Q06 responses
   - Deliver Q02 mini-lesson on z-score â†’ proportion
   - Meet with red-light students (1:1 or small group)

2. **Next Week:**
   - Exit ticket to assess Q02 misconception fix
   - Begin Unit 2 with confidence, knowing Unit 1 gaps are being addressed
   - Continue monitoring yellow students

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Spiral review of normal distribution concepts throughout Unit 2-3
   - Emphasize CR completion expectations
   - Track mastery trends (see `reports/trends-summary.md`)

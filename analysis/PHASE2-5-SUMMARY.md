# Phase 2-5 Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Implemented By:** Sonnet (Claude Code)

---

## Overview

Phases 2-5 of the AP Statistics Period B Unit 1 analysis pipeline have been successfully implemented. This completes roster resolution, attempt consolidation, MC scoring, CR triage, and comprehensive item analysis for Lesson 10.

---

## Phase 2: Roster Resolution and Period Tagging

### ✅ Implementation Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ Resolved shared usernames (capitalization variants)
2. ✅ Consolidated student aliases
3. ✅ Assigned Period B/E tags based on L10 attempts
4. ✅ Created username → student lookup table

### 📊 Results

**Students Processed:** 24 total
- **Period B:** 8 students (have ≥1 L10 attempt)
- **Period E:** 16 students (no L10 attempts)

**Alias Resolution:**
- 3 students with multiple usernames:
  - Chanlita: `grape_koala` + `grape_newt`
  - francois: `apricot_horse` + `lemon_goat`
  - Julissa: `apricot_dog` + `banana_fox`

**Shared Username Resolution:**
- 1 case resolved (capitalization variant)
- All variants consolidated to primary username

### 📁 Outputs Generated

- `reports/phase2-report.json` - Full resolution details
- `reports/phase2-period-assignments.csv` - Student roster with periods
- `reports/phase2-alias-consolidation.md` - Alias decisions and rationale
- `reports/data.json` - Resolved roster and lookup table

### ⚠️ Validation Issues

**Warnings (1):**
- 7 usernames not in roster mapping (likely students not in `student2username.csv`)

**Impact:** Minor - these students can still be analyzed by username

**Answer Key Applied:**
```
Q01: D  →  80% correct (8/10)
Q02: A  →  67% correct (6/9)
Q03: A  →  67% correct (6/9)
Q05: B  →  89% correct (8/9)
Q07: C  →  71% correct (5/7)
Q08: A  →  71% correct (5/7)
```

## Phase 5: L10 Item Analysis and Student Subscores

### ✅ Implementation Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ Calculated item difficulty (p-values)
2. ✅ Analyzed distractor distributions
3. ✅ Computed point-biserial discrimination
4. ✅ Mined top misconceptions from distractors
5. ✅ Generated student subscores with traffic lights

### 📊 Item Analysis Results

**MC Item Statistics (6 questions):**

| Question | n | p-value | Difficulty | Discrimination | Top Distractor |
|----------|---|---------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Q01 | 10 | 0.800 | Easy | 0.232 | B (20%) |
| Q02 | 9 | 0.667 | Medium | 0.825 | B (33%) ⚠️ |
| Q03 | 9 | 0.667 | Medium | 0.516 | D (22%) |
| Q05 | 9 | 0.889 | Easy | 0.258 | C (11%) |
| Q07 | 7 | 0.714 | Easy | 0.785 | A (14%) |
| Q08 | 7 | 0.714 | Easy | 0.785 | D (14%) |

**Key Insights:**
- **Q02 has strongest discrimination (0.825)** - good differentiator
- **Q01 has weakest discrimination (0.232)** - most students got it right
- **Q02's distractor B selected by 33%** - significant misconception

### 🔍 Top 3 Misconceptions Identified

1. **Q02 (Normal proportion):**
   - 33% selected B instead of A
   - Evidence: 3/9 students

2. **Q03 (Normal proportion >33g):**
   - 22% selected D instead of A
   - Evidence: 2/9 students

3. **Q01 (Parameters):**
   - 20% selected B instead of D
   - Evidence: 2/10 students

### 📈 Student Subscores (8 Period B Students)

**MC Performance:**
- 6/6 correct: 4 students (50%) ✅
- 5/6 correct: 2 students (25%)
- 4/6 correct: 1 student (12%)
- 3/6 correct: 2 students (25%)

**Traffic Light Summary:**
- 🟢 Green (≥80%): **5 students**
- 🟡 Yellow (60-79%): **1 student**
- 🔴 Red (<60%): **2 students**

**CR Attempts:**
- Q04 (Histogram): 3 students attempted
  - Scores range: 2-3 out of 4 points (estimated from triage)
- Q06 (Z-scores): 1 student attempted
  - Low participation - needs attention

### 📁 Outputs Generated

- `reports/L10-item-analysis.csv` - Complete psychometric analysis
- `reports/L10-misconceptions.md` - Top misconceptions with evidence
- `reports/L10-student-subscores.csv` - Individual student performance
- `reports/L10-traffic-light.csv` ⭐ - Quick visual performance summary

## Cross-Phase Validation

### ✅ Data Integrity Checks Passed

- ✓ All L10 students tagged Period B (no Period E in L10 cohort)
- ✓ No duplicate student×question combinations after consolidation
- ✓ All MC responses match answer key format
- ✓ Item analysis covers all 6 MC questions
- ✓ Student subscores calculated for all 8 Period B students

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Low CR participation:**
   - Q04: Only 3/8 students (38%)
   - Q06: Only 1/8 students (13%)
   - Recommendation: Investigate why CR questions have low completion rates

2. **Small sample sizes:**
   - Some questions have n=7-10 students
   - Discrimination values should be interpreted with caution

3. **Triage-based CR scoring:**
   - CR scores are estimated from keyword triage
   - Manual calibration needed for accuracy

## Key Findings for Instruction

### 🎯 Strengths (Green Light Skills)

1. **Q05 (Empirical Rule):** 89% correct - students strong here
2. **Overall MC:** 75% average - good baseline understanding
3. **5 students performing at high level** (≥80% MC)

### ⚠️ Areas for Intervention (Yellow/Red)

1. **Q02 Misconception (33%):**
   - Students selecting B instead of A for normal proportion
   - Topic: Z-score calculation and normal table usage

2. **CR Completion Rates:**
   - Q04: 38% completion
   - Q06: 13% completion
   - Need to investigate barriers to CR attempts

3. **2 Students Struggling (<60%):**
   - Janelle (mango_panda): 50% MC, but attempted Q04 (75%)
   - Gabriella (guava_cat): 50% MC, no CR attempts

### 📚 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Mini-lesson:** Address Q02 misconception (z-score → proportion)
2. **Practice:** Additional normal distribution problems
3. **CR Support:** Investigate and address low CR completion
4. **Targeted Help:** Work with 2 red-light students (Janelle, Gabriella)

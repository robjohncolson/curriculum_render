## Your Learning Path

Hi Janelle! You showed excellent effort on the histogram question (Q04), scoring 75%. This tells me you understand how to interpret distributions. Now let's strengthen your multiple choice skills, especially with z-scores and the normal model.

**Goal:** Master z-score calculations and normal proportions

## Practice Set (5 Items)

### Item 1: Z-Score Calculation
**Topic:** Lesson 9 - Z-scores and Standardization

The weights of chocolate bars are normally distributed with mean Î¼ = 52g and standard deviation Ïƒ = 1.5g.

**Question:** Calculate the z-score for a chocolate bar weighing 49g.

**Formula Reminder:**
```
z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ
```

**Show your work:**

---

### Item 2: Normal Proportion (Below)
**Topic:** Lesson 10 - Working with Normal Distributions

Using the same distribution (Î¼ = 52g, Ïƒ = 1.5g):

**Question:** What proportion of chocolate bars weigh LESS than 49g?

**Steps:**
1. Calculate z-score (you did this in Item 1!)
2. Look up z in Table A
3. The table value IS your proportion

**Answer:**

---

### Item 3: Normal Proportion (Above)
**Topic:** Lesson 10 - Working with Normal Distributions

**Question:** What proportion of chocolate bars weigh MORE than 55g?

**Steps:**
1. Calculate z = (55 - 52) / 1.5 = ___
2. Look up z in Table A: ___
3. For "more than": 1 - (table value) = ___

**Answer:**

---

### Item 4: Empirical Rule Application
**Topic:** Lesson 8 - The Normal Model

The weights are still normally distributed with Î¼ = 52g and Ïƒ = 1.5g.

**Question:** Between what two weights do the middle 95% of chocolate bars fall?

**Hint:** Empirical Rule says 95% fall within Â±2 standard deviations of the mean.

**Answer:**

---

### Item 5: Interpretation in Context
**Topic:** Lesson 10 - Working with Normal Distributions

You found that 2.3% of chocolate bars weigh more than 55g.

**Question:** Write one sentence explaining what this means in the context of chocolate bar weights.

**Answer:**

---

## Q06 Scaffold: Z-Score Practice (Bonus)

You didn't attempt Q06 on L10. Let's build up to it!

### Q06 Simplified Version

**Given:** Reese's cups have Î¼ = 48.5g and Ïƒ = 1.2g

**Part A:** Calculate z-score for 46g
```
z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ = (46 - ___) / ___ = ___
```

**Part B:** Calculate z-score for 51g
```
z = (51 - ___) / ___ = ___
```

**Part C:** What proportion fall BETWEEN 46g and 51g?

**Strategy:**
1. Find proportion below 51g: ___
2. Find proportion below 46g: ___
3. Subtract: (proportion below 51g) - (proportion below 46g) = ___

## Success Checklist

After completing this practice, you should be able to:

- âœ“ Calculate z-scores using the formula
- âœ“ Use Table A to find proportions below a z-score
- âœ“ Find proportions above by subtracting from 1
- âœ“ Apply the empirical rule (68-95-99.7)
- âœ“ Interpret statistical results in context

---

## Answer Key (Check After Attempting)

**Item 1:** z = (49 - 52) / 1.5 = -2.0

**Item 2:** z = -2.0 â†’ Table A shows 0.0228 â‰ˆ 2.3%

**Item 3:** z = 2.0 â†’ Table A shows 0.9772 â†’ Above = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228 â‰ˆ 2.3%

**Item 4:** Î¼ Â± 2Ïƒ = 52 Â± 2(1.5) = 52 Â± 3 â†’ Between 49g and 55g

**Item 5:** "About 2.3% of chocolate bars weigh more than 55 grams." (or similar)

**Q06 Scaffold:**
- Part A: z = (46 - 48.5) / 1.2 = -2.08
- Part B: z = (51 - 48.5) / 1.2 = 2.08
- Part C: 0.9812 - 0.0188 = 0.9624 â‰ˆ 96%

## Next Steps

1. **Complete this practice** - take your time and show all work
2. **Check your answers** - understand any mistakes
3. **See Ms./Mr. [Teacher]** - get feedback on Q06 scaffold
4. **Retake opportunity** - show your improved skills!

You're already showing strong CR reasoning (75% on Q04). Once you nail z-scores, you'll be in great shape! ðŸ’ª

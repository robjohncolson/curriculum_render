# CR Blitz Plan: L10 Missing Responses

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes
**Target:** 5 students missing Q04, 7 students missing Q06
**Date Generated:** October 9, 2025

---

## Critical Issue

**Q04 Completion:** 3/8 students (38%)
**Q06 Completion:** 1/8 students (13%)

Most Period B students have not attempted constructed response questions, preventing full assessment of histogram interpretation and z-score application skills.

---

## Setup (Before Class)

### Materials
- Timer (visible on projector/board)
- Rubric success criteria written on board
- Blank paper or response sheets for students

### Board Display
```
CR BLITZ - 12 Minutes

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Q04 (Histogram - 4 points):
✓ Correct histogram drawn with bars
✓ Shape described (symmetric/skewed)
✓ Center identified (around 48-49g)
✓ Context mentioned (Reese's weights)

Q06 (Z-scores - 3 points):
✓ Z-score calculated for 46g
✓ Z-score calculated for 51g
✓ Proportion between them found
```

## Implementation (12 minutes)

### Opening (1 min)
> "Most of you skipped the constructed response questions on L10. These are worth significant points and test critical skills. You have 12 minutes to complete both. Timer starts now."

### Work Time (10 min)
- Start visible timer
- Students work silently on Q04 and Q06
- Circulate to ensure students are attempting both questions
- Provide formula sheet reminder: z = (x - μ) / σ

### Closing (1 min)
- Collect all responses
- "These will be scored with the rubric on the board. We'll review common mistakes tomorrow."

## Questions to Assign

### Q04: Histogram Interpretation
**Prompt:** "The weights of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are approximately normal with mean 48.5g and standard deviation 1.2g. Create a histogram showing this distribution and describe its shape and center."

**Scoring Rubric (4 points):**
- 1 pt: Histogram drawn with appropriate bars
- 1 pt: Shape correctly described as symmetric/bell-shaped
- 1 pt: Center identified (48-49g range acceptable)
- 1 pt: Distribution described in context of Reese's weights

### Q06: Z-scores and Proportions
**Prompt:** "Using μ = 48.5g and σ = 1.2g:
a) Calculate the z-score for a Reese's cup weighing 46g
b) Calculate the z-score for one weighing 51g
c) What proportion of cups weigh between 46g and 51g?"

**Scoring Rubric (3 points):**
- 1 pt: Correct z-score for 46g (z ≈ -2.08)
- 1 pt: Correct z-score for 51g (z ≈ 2.08)
- 1 pt: Correct proportion calculated (≈ 96%)

## Missing Students by Question

### Q04 Missing (5 students)
- edgar (apple_monkey) - Green overall, needs CR practice
- Ana (papaya_eagle) - Green overall, needs CR practice
- Justin (apricot_horse) - Green overall, needs CR practice
- Gabriella (guava_cat) - **Red overall, high priority**
- francois (apricot_horse) - Green overall, needs CR practice
- Keily (apricot_fox) - Green overall, needs CR practice

### Q06 Missing (7 students - all except Hazel)
- edgar, Ana, Justin, Janelle, Gabriella, francois, Keily
- **Janelle and Gabriella are red-light students - priority**

---

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate (Next Class)
1. Score all CR responses using rubrics
2. Update student subscores
3. Identify persistent misconceptions

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Provide written feedback on CR responses
2. Offer retake opportunity for red-light students
3. Review z-score calculations if Q06 shows systematic errors

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **Completion Rate:** Target 100% for both Q04 and Q06
- **Quality:** Expect 60-70% to score ≥75% on each question
- **Data Benefit:** Full skill assessment for histogram and z-score standards

---

## Notes for Teacher

- Emphasize that CR questions test **deeper understanding** than MC
- Students who excel at MC but avoid CR may have procedural gaps
- Use this blitz to normalize CR completion expectations for future assessments

**Priority Students:** Watch Janelle and Gabriella closely - they need CR confidence building.

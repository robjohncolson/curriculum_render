## Your Learning Path

Hi Gabriella! Let's build your confidence with normal distributions and z-scores. I've created a step-by-step practice set that starts simple and builds up.

**Goal:** Master z-score calculations and feel confident attempting constructed response questions

---

## Practice Set (5 Items)

### Item 1: Z-Score Calculation (Starter)
**Topic:** Lesson 9 - Z-scores and Standardization

The weights of chocolate bars are normally distributed with mean Î¼ = 52g and standard deviation Ïƒ = 1.5g.

**Question:** Calculate the z-score for a chocolate bar weighing 49g.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Identify: x = 49, Î¼ = 52, Ïƒ = 1.5
2. Use formula: z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ
3. Substitute: z = (49 - 52) / 1.5
4. Calculate: z = -3 / 1.5 = ___

**Answer:** z = ___

---

### Item 2: Understanding Z-Scores
**Topic:** Lesson 9 - Interpretation

**Question:** What does a z-score of -2.0 tell you?

Choose the best answer:
- A) The value is 2 standard deviations below the mean
- B) The value is 2 grams below the mean
- C) The value is negative and therefore impossible
- D) The value is 2% below the mean

**Answer:** ___

**Explanation:**

### Item 3: Normal Proportion (Below)
**Topic:** Lesson 10 - Working with Normal Distributions

Using the same distribution (Î¼ = 52g, Ïƒ = 1.5g), and knowing z = -2.0 for a 49g bar:

**Question:** What proportion of chocolate bars weigh LESS than 49g?

**Steps:**
1. You already know z = -2.0 from Item 1
2. Look up z = -2.0 in Table A
3. Find: 0.0228
4. **This IS your proportion!**

**Answer:** About ___ % of chocolate bars weigh less than 49g

---

### Item 4: Empirical Rule (Visual)
**Topic:** Lesson 8 - The Normal Model

Draw a simple bell curve and mark these values:
- Mean (Î¼ = 52g) in the center
- One standard deviation above (52 + 1.5 = 53.5g)
- One standard deviation below (52 - 1.5 = 50.5g)

**Question:** According to the empirical rule, what percentage of chocolate bars weigh between 50.5g and 53.5g?

**Hint:** This is Â±1 standard deviation from the mean.

**Answer:** ___ %

### Item 5: Interpretation in Context
**Topic:** Lesson 10 - Working with Normal Distributions

**Question:** You calculated that 2.3% of chocolate bars weigh less than 49g. Write one complete sentence explaining what this means.

**Sentence:**

## CR Starter: Build Your Confidence

You didn't attempt the constructed response questions on L10. Let's start with something simpler!

### Simple Histogram Task

**Given:** Chocolate bar weights are normally distributed with Î¼ = 52g and Ïƒ = 1.5g

**Task:** Draw a simple bell curve (histogram) showing this distribution.

**Include:**
1. Draw a bell/mound shape
2. Label the center (Î¼ = 52g)
3. Mark one standard deviation on each side:
   - Left: 52 - 1.5 = 50.5g
   - Right: 52 + 1.5 = 53.5g
4. Write one sentence: "The distribution is ___ with center at ___"

**Draw your histogram here:**

### Z-Score Formula Practice (Build to Q06)

**Given:** Reese's cups have Î¼ = 48.5g and Ïƒ = 1.2g

Fill in the blanks to practice the formula:

**For a 46g Reese's cup:**
```
z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ
z = (___ - ___) / ___
z = ___ / ___
z = ___
```

**For a 51g Reese's cup:**
```
z = (___ - ___) / ___
z = ___ / ___
z = ___
```

---

## Success Checklist

After completing this practice, you should be able to:

- âœ“ Calculate z-scores using the formula (step-by-step)
- âœ“ Understand what z-scores mean (distance from mean)
- âœ“ Use Table A to find basic proportions
- âœ“ Apply the empirical rule
- âœ“ Draw and label a simple bell curve
- âœ“ Interpret results in context

---

## Answer Key (Check After Attempting)

**Item 1:** z = (49 - 52) / 1.5 = -3 / 1.5 = -2.0

**Item 2:** A - The value is 2 standard deviations below the mean

**Item 3:** Look up z = -2.0 in Table A â†’ 0.0228 â†’ About 2.3% of chocolate bars weigh less than 49g

**Item 4:** 68% (This is the empirical rule: 68% fall within Â±1Ïƒ)

**Item 5:** "About 2.3% of chocolate bars in this population weigh less than 49 grams." (or similar)

**CR Starter:**
- Your bell curve should be mound-shaped
- Center labeled 52g
- Sides labeled 50.5g (left) and 53.5g (right)
- Sentence: "The distribution is symmetric/bell-shaped with center at 52g"

**Z-Score Formula Practice:**
- For 46g: z = (46 - 48.5) / 1.2 = -2.5 / 1.2 = -2.08
- For 51g: z = (51 - 48.5) / 1.2 = 2.5 / 1.2 = 2.08

## Next Steps

1. **Complete this practice** - work through each item slowly
2. **Check your answers** - learn from any mistakes
3. **Show your CR starter** to Ms./Mr. [Teacher] - get feedback!
4. **Try Q04 and Q06** - you're ready now!

Remember: Constructed response questions aren't about being perfect. They're about showing your thinking. You've got this! ğŸ’ª

## Confidence Builder

**Why you can do this:**
- You got 50% of MC correct - that's a solid foundation
- The questions you missed are all about z-scores - a VERY learnable skill
- CR questions let you show partial understanding and earn partial credit
- With practice, z-scores become automatic!

**Next time:** Attempt ALL questions, even if you're not 100% sure. Partial credit > no credit!

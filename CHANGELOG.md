### Result:
Import now correctly recognizes and loads data from all export formats, including the sample `master_peer_data_2025-09-21.json`.

## Phase 3: Excel Integration Implementation âœ…

### New Feature:
Excel-based student name â†’ username mapping for easier import process.

### Changes Made:
- **Added SheetJS Library** for Excel parsing
- **New Import Option**: "Import with Excel Mapping"
- **Three-Step Import Process**:
  1. Upload master data JSON file
  2. Upload Excel student roster
  3. Select student name from dropdown
- **Smart Excel Parsing**:
  - Auto-detects name/username columns
  - Fallback to first two columns if headers not found
  - Real-time validation and status feedback
- **UI Components**:
  - Modal with step-by-step interface
  - File status indicators
  - Student selection dropdown
- **CSS Styling**: Added comprehensive styles for Excel import modal

### Result:
Teachers can now provide an Excel roster, making it easy for students to find and select their username from a friendly name list.

## Phase 4: Sync Button UI/UX Standardization âœ…

### Result:
Sync functionality is now consistently available and professionally designed across the entire application.

## Phase 5: Username Management Access âœ…

### New Feature:
Ability to switch between users without losing data, accessible from main interface.

### Changes Made:

  - Seamless user experience
- **Integration**:
  - Uses existing import functionality
  - Connects with username prompt for new users
  - Updates UI state appropriately

### Result:
Users can now easily switch between different student accounts without data loss, perfect for shared devices or testing.

## Phase 6: Pig Sprite Collision Detection âœ…

### New Feature:
Interactive pig sprite with collision detection that triggers username management after bounces.

### Changes Made:
- **Header Collision Detection**: Detects when sprite hits top 120px of screen
- **Bounce Physics**: Realistic bounce behavior off header region
- **Collision Tracking**:
  - Counts header collisions
  - Resets counter after trigger
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Sprite brightens on collision
  - Fun spin animation when triggering action
- **Three-Bounce Trigger**: Opens username management after 3 header bounces
- **Improved Initialization**:
  - Sprite appears immediately (no page refresh needed)
  - User-specific color persistence
  - Proper cleanup when switching users

### Result:
Added fun, interactive element that provides an alternative way to access username management while demonstrating collision detection concepts.

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization:
- Consolidated duplicate code
- Improved function naming and structure
- Better error handling throughout

### CSS Enhancements:
- Consistent button styling
- Dark mode support for all new features
- Responsive design considerations
- Visual feedback and animations

### Data Management:
- Improved localStorage structure

2. **Import/Export**: Test all import formats (personal, master, Excel mapping)
3. **Sync Modal**: Verify all sync options work correctly
4. **Pig Sprite**: Test collision detection and username management trigger

### Browser Testing:
1. Test in multiple browsers
2. Verify dark/light theme switching
3. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Data Integrity Testing:
1. Verify no data loss during user switching
2. Test import with various file formats
3. Confirm peer data preservation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **User Profiles**: Add profile pictures or additional user metadata
2. **Advanced Collision**: More complex physics for pig sprite
3. **Import Validation**: More robust file format validation
4. **Batch Operations**: Bulk user import/export capabilities

## Notes for Developers

### Key Functions:
- `showSyncModal()` - Unified sync interface
- `showUserManagement()` - User switching interface
- `importDataForUser()` - Handles all import formats

● Code Quality Analysis of index.html

  Critical Issues:

  1. Monolithic File Structure (45,473 lines!)
    - Everything (HTML, CSS, JS, data) is in a single file
    - Makes debugging, testing, and maintenance extremely difficult
    - Loading performance severely impacted (1.9MB file)
  2. Massive Inline Data
    - ~40,000+ lines are hardcoded quiz/lesson data
    - Should be loaded dynamically from external JSON files
    - Makes version control diffs unreadable
  3. Function Duplication
    - renderTable() defined twice (index.html:43373, index.html:43665)
    - Multiple renderChart() variations with overlapping logic
    - Repeated attachment rendering code
  4. High Cyclomatic Complexity
    - submitAnswer() function (index.html:43839) has 60+ lines with nested conditions
    - renderMCQDistribution() has complex chart configuration inline
    - Multiple functions exceed 100 lines
  5. Global State Management
    - Variables like currentUsername, classData, chartInstances are global
    - No proper state management pattern
    - Risk of data corruption and race conditions

  Performance Bottlenecks:

  1. Synchronous LocalStorage Operations
    - Frequent localStorage.setItem() calls block the main thread
    - No debouncing on save operations
  2. Chart Memory Leaks
    - Chart instances not always properly destroyed
    - Canvas elements not cleared before re-rendering
  3. Inefficient DOM Manipulation
    - String concatenation for HTML generation
    - No virtual DOM or efficient update patterns

  Recommended Refactoring:

  1. Split into Multiple Files:
  /src
    /js
      - app.js (main logic)
      - charts.js (chart rendering)
      - quiz.js (quiz functionality)
      - storage.js (data persistence)
    /css
      - styles.css
      - dark-theme.css
    /data
      - units.json
      - questions.json
  index.html (minimal HTML shell)
  2. Extract Data to JSON Files
    - Move all quiz/lesson data to external JSON
    - Load dynamically based on user selection
    - Implement lazy loading for better performance
  3. Implement Module Pattern
    - Use ES6 modules or IIFE pattern
    - Create proper namespacing
    - Reduce global scope pollution
  4. Add Build Process
    - Use webpack/rollup for bundling
    - Implement code splitting
    - Add minification and compression
  5. Improve State Management
    - Implement pub/sub or observer pattern
    - Create centralized store
    - Add proper error handling
  6. Optimize Chart Rendering
    - Implement chart pooling/reuse
    - Add debouncing for updates
    - Use requestAnimationFrame for animations

  This refactoring would dramatically improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience while reducing the file from 45K lines to likely under 1000 lines of core
  application code.

> Human: You've identified several refactoring opportunities in the order.js file. Can you help me prioritize these based on:
  1. Which changes would provide the most immediate benefit to maintainability
  2. Which changes would be safest to implement (lowest risk of introducing bugs)
  3. Which changes would lay groundwork for future improvements

● I need to analyze the order.js file first, as I was previously looking at index.html. Let me examine order.js to provide accurate refactoring priorities.

● Read(order.js)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Bash(ls -la /mnt/c/Users/rober/OneDrive/Desktop/curriculum_render/*.js)
  ⎿  -rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 94233 Sep 15 08:16 /mnt/c/Users/rober/OneDrive/Desktop/curriculum_render/allUnitsData.js

● Let me check for the actual JavaScript files in this project:

● Bash(find /mnt/c/Users/rober/OneDrive/Desktop/curriculum_render -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | head -20)
  ⎿  /mnt/c/Users/rober/OneDrive/Desktop/curriculum_render/allUnitsData.js
     /mnt/c/Users/rober/OneDrive/Desktop/curriculum_render/index.html

● I see there's no order.js file. Based on my previous analysis of index.html, let me provide refactoring priorities for that file's JavaScript code:

● Refactoring Prioritization for index.html JavaScript Code

  1. Most Immediate Benefit to Maintainability (High Impact, Do First)

  Priority 1: Extract inline data to external files
  - Move 40,000+ lines of quiz/lesson data to allUnitsData.js (already exists)
  - Reduces file from 45K to ~5K lines
  - Makes code searchable and version control usable
  - Implementation: Simple cut/paste + add script tag

  Priority 2: Fix duplicate function definitions
  - Remove duplicate renderTable() function
  - Consolidate chart rendering functions
  - Immediate reduction in confusion and bugs
  - Zero risk - just removing duplicates

  Priority 3: Create basic module structure
  // Wrap in IIFE to avoid globals
  const QuizApp = (function() {
      // Private variables
      let currentUsername = '';
      let classData = {};

      // Public API
      return {
          init: init,
          submitAnswer: submitAnswer,
          // etc.
      };
  })();

  2. Safest Changes to Implement (Lowest Risk)

  Safe Change 1: Add constants for magic numbers
  const CONFIG = {
      MAX_ATTEMPTS: 3,
      CHART_HEIGHT: 400,
      ANIMATION_DURATION: 300,
      SUCCESS_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT: 3000
  };

  Safe Change 2: Extract CSS to separate file
  - Pure separation of concerns
  - No JavaScript logic changes needed
  - Can be tested visually

  Safe Change 3: Add JSDoc comments
  /**
   * Submits a quiz answer
   * @param {string} questionId - The question identifier
   * @param {string} questionType - 'multiple-choice' or 'free-response'
   */
  function submitAnswer(questionId, questionType) {

  3. Foundational Improvements for Future Work

  Foundation 1: Implement event delegation
  // Instead of inline onclick handlers
  document.getElementById('quiz-container').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
      if (e.target.classList.contains('submit-button')) {
          const questionId = e.target.dataset.questionId;
          submitAnswer(questionId);
      }
  });

  Foundation 2: Create data access layer
  class DataService {
      async loadUnit(unitId) {
          // Future: Load from API
          return allUnitsData[unitId];
      }

      saveProgress(username, data) {
          // Abstracted storage
          localStorage.setItem(`${username}_progress`, JSON.stringify(data));
      }
  }

  Foundation 3: Set up build process structure
  // package.json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "webpack",
      "dev": "webpack-dev-server"
    }
  }

  Recommended Implementation Order:

● Week 1 (Quick Wins):
  1. Extract quiz data to external JSON/JS files (4 hours)
  2. Remove duplicate functions (1 hour)
  3. Extract CSS to styles.css (2 hours)

  Week 2 (Safety First):
  1. Add configuration constants (2 hours)
  2. Add JSDoc comments to main functions (3 hours)
  3. Create basic IIFE wrapper for namespace (2 hours)

  Week 3 (Foundation):
  1. Implement event delegation pattern (4 hours)
  2. Create DataService abstraction (6 hours)
  3. Set up basic webpack config (4 hours)

  Week 4 (Advanced):
  1. Split into multiple JS modules (8 hours)
  2. Implement proper state management (6 hours)
  3. Add error boundaries and logging (4 hours)

  This approach minimizes risk while maximizing immediate benefits. The data extraction alone will make the codebase 90% more manageable, and each subsequent step builds on stable
  foundations without breaking existing functionality.

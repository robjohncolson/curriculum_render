1,Which statement best describes what the correlation coefficient r tells you about two quantitative variables?,It gives the direction and the strength of a linear association between x and y,It reports the average change in y for a one-unit increase in x,It quantifies any type of association linear or curved with equal accuracy,It measures how much changes in x cause changes in y,30,1
2,If r = 0 between two variables what can we definitively conclude?,There is no linear relationship between the variables,The variables are completely independent in every way,The slope of the regression line must equal 0,Neither variable can be used to predict the other,30,1
3,You convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and distance from miles to kilometers. How does this affect r?,r remains exactly the same because it's unitless,r increases because metric units are more precise,r decreases due to the double conversion,r becomes undefined due to mixed unit systems,30,1
4,If you swap x and y (predicting x from y instead of y from x) what happens to r?,It remains exactly the same,It becomes 1/r (the reciprocal),It changes sign but keeps the same magnitude,It depends on which variable has more variation,30,1
5,A scatterplot shows points in a perfect U-shape (parabola). What would r approximately equal?,0 because there's no linear relationship,1 because there's a perfect pattern,-1 because some points decrease,0.5 because it's halfway between increasing and decreasing,30,1
6,A single outlier is added far from a linear cloud of points. What's the most likely impact on r?,Substantial change as r is sensitive to outliers,No impact as r is resistant to outliers,r automatically becomes 0 due to non-linearity,r moves toward ±1 due to the increased range,30,1
7,Two datasets have very different regression slopes but points hug their lines tightly. Which is most accurate?,Both could have similar r values as r measures scatter not steepness,The steeper slope must have the larger |r|,The shallower slope must have the smaller |r|,r equals the slope times the ratio of standard deviations,30,1
8,Multiplying all y-values by -1 (flipping the vertical axis) will:,Change the sign of r but keep its magnitude the same,Leave r unchanged in both sign and magnitude,Make |r| larger due to increased spread,Make r undefined for negative values,30,1
9,Maine's divorce rate and margarine consumption show strong correlation over 10 years. This best illustrates:,A spurious correlation likely due to coincidence or common time trends,Margarine consumption strains marriages through health stress,Reverse causation where divorce drives comfort eating,An undiscovered biological mechanism linking diet to relationships,30,1
10,A study samples only students with 90-98% attendance (restricted range). What typically happens to |r|?,It decreases because range restriction attenuates relationships,It increases due to more homogeneous data,It becomes exactly 0 from lack of variation,It flips sign in narrow ranges,30,1
11,Variables like hunger and school quality in the attendance-achievement story are best described as:,Lurking variables that independently affect both,Mediators between attendance and test scores,Moderators that change the correlation's strength,Outcomes that result from poor test scores,30,1
12,If every point lies exactly on a line with negative slope what is r?,-1 indicating perfect negative linear relationship,0 because negative relationships have no correlation,+1 because it's a perfect fit regardless of direction,It depends on the specific slope value,30,1
13,A student claims: Since r = 0.95 the regression slope must be 0.95. This is:,Correct as r and slope are always equal,Incorrect; slope = r(sy/sx) depending on standard deviations,Correct only when variables have the same units,Incorrect; slope = r² in all cases,30,2
14,Why is examining the scatterplot essential even when |r| is large?,To verify the calculated r value visually,To identify outliers curvature or clusters that r alone misses,To determine the sample size from point density,To establish causation if points form a tight line,30,2
15,If r = 0.6 between study hours and exam scores what percentage of score variation is explained by study hours?,60% since r = 0.6,36% since r² = 0.36,40% since 1 - 0.6 = 0.4,Cannot determine without the regression equation,30,2
16,Why is the correlation coefficient unitless?,It averages the units of x and y to cancel them,It uses standardized (z-score) values that remove units,It's always expressed as a percentage,It divides covariance by variance to eliminate units,30,2
17,Two groups each show positive correlation internally but combined data show r ? 0. This demonstrates:,Calculation errors when combining datasets,Simpson's paradox where aggregation reverses patterns,Proof that correlation depends on sample size,The groups must have had negative correlations,30,2
18,A researcher doubles the sample size with similar data following the same pattern. The most likely effect on r is:,r increases toward ±1 as patterns strengthen,r stays similar but becomes more precisely estimated,r decreases toward 0 due to regression to the mean,r exactly doubles with the sample size,30,2
19,A student argues: If correlation doesn't imply causation then we can never prove smoking causes cancer. The flaw is:,Smoking-cancer correlation is actually weak,Causation can be established through proper experimental design and multiple lines of evidence,Medical relationships are exempt from statistical rules,Correlation does imply causation for harmful substances,30,2
20,When is it most appropriate to summarize an association with r?,Whenever two variables are quantitative regardless of shape,Only when n ? 30,Only when both variables share the same units,When the scatterplot is roughly linear with no extreme outliers,30,4
21,Which task specifically requires the scatterplot (not r alone)?,Determining positive vs. negative direction,Computing the exact value of r,Confirming -1 ? r ? 1,Identifying a curved pattern or multiple clusters,30,4
22,A policy analyst wants to test whether raising attendance causes higher scores. Which design is most appropriate?,Compare schools with naturally high vs. low attendance,Fit a regression and look for a steep slope,Recompute r with a larger observational dataset,Randomly assign students to attendance-support vs. control and compare scores,30,4
23,Which fallacy is most at risk when interpreting a plot of group averages to make claims about individuals?,Regression to the mean,Simpson's paradox reversal,Base-rate neglect,Ecological inference error (inferring about individuals from group data),30,4
24,After controlling for hunger school quality and study time the attendancescore correlation shrinks markedly. What is the best interpretation?,The original slope must have been miscalculated,Random error is eliminated by controlling variables,The variables are now independent in every subgroup,The original association was partly due to confounding by these variables,30,4
25,Computer output shows r = 0.89 for a dataset but the residual plot shows a clear curved pattern. What should you conclude?,The correlation was calculated incorrectly since residuals show curvature,Despite high r a non-linear model might be more appropriate than linear,The residual plot must be wrong because r is close to 1,A correlation of 0.89 guarantees the linear model is appropriate,30,2

U3-L5-Q02
To prevent deer from running across highways, researchers are investigating sound-emitting devices that would frighten deer before they reach the highway. As part of the investigation, the researchers set up devices along a two-mile stretch of road. When a deer approached a device, the device would activate and emit a sound. The researchers recorded whether the deer moved toward the highway (positive response), away from the highway (negative response), or did not move (neutral response). The researchers kept the loudness of the sound constant at 60 decibels. However, they varied the pitch of the sound. There were 6 treatment levels, all measured in kilohertz (\(\text{kHz}\)): 0, 0.28, 1, 8, 15, and 28. The order of the treatments was randomly assigned.

The manufacturer of a certain type of new cell phone battery claims that the average life span of the batteries is 500 charges; that is, the battery can be charged at least 500 times before failing. To investigate the claim, a consumer group will select a random sample of cell phones with the new battery and use the phones through 500 charges of the battery. The proportion of batteries that fail to last through 500 charges will be recorded. The results will be used to construct a 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the proportion of all such batteries that fail to last through 500 charges.

A fair die, with its faces numbered from 1 to 6, is one in which each number is equally likely to land face up when the die is rolled. On a fair die, the probability that the number 6 will land face up is \(\frac{1}{6}\). A group of students wanted to investigate a claim about manipulating a fair die so that it favors one outcome. The claim states that if a fair die is put into an oven and baked at 200°F for 10 minutes, the inside of the die will begin to melt. When the die cools, the inside will be solid again, but with more weight toward the bottom. This shift in weight will cause the face that was up when the die cooled to land up more often that the other faces.

The students obtained a fair die and baked it according to the preceding directions. The die cooled with the number 6 face up. After the die cooled, they rolled the die 200 times, and the number 6 landed face up 43 times. Let \(p\) represent the population proportion of times the number 6 will land face up on the baked die if the die could be rolled an infinite number of times.

(a) Clarke, one of the students, constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for \(p\) as \(0.215 \pm 0.057\). Does the interval provide convincing statistical evidence that the number 6 will land face up more often on the baked die than on a fair die? Explain your reasoning.

(b) Aurelia, another student, suggested they conduct a significance test to investigate the claim. She tested the hypotheses \(H_0: p = \frac{1}{6}\) versus \(H_a: p > \frac{1}{6}\) at the significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\). She obtained a test statistic of \(z = 1.83\) with a p-value of 0.033. Do the results of the significance test agree with the results of Clarke's confidence interval in part (a)? Explain your reasoning.

(c) Two standard normal curves are shown below, one for the confidence interval calculated in part (a) and one for the significance test conducted in part (b).

(i) For the confidence interval curve, label the critical values for the 95% confidence level and shade the area that represents values in the outer 5%.

(ii) For the significance test curve, label the critical value for the 5% significance level and shade the area representing the values of \(z\) that would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis in part (b).

(d) Joachim, a third student, noted that the confidence interval in part (a) gives plausible values of the parameter as an interval between two values. He suggested that they develop a one-sided confidence interval because they were only concerned with whether the number 6 was landing face up more often than expected, not less often. The one-sided-interval will determine a value \(L\) such that all plausible values of \(p\) are greater than \(L\). The formula for \(L\) is \(L = \hat{p} - z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\).

(i) Determine the values of \(z^*\) needed to create the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval. Then calculate the value of \(L\).

(ii) Do the results of Joachim's one-sided confidence interval agree with results of Aurelia's significance test in part (b)? Explain your reasoning.

Fingerprint analysis and blood grouping are features that do not change through the lifetime of an individual. Fingerprint features appear early in the development of a fetus, and blood types are determined by genetics. Therefore, each is considered an effective tool for identification of individuals. These characteristics are also of interest in the discipline of biological anthropology—a scientific discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings.

The relationship between these characteristics was the subject of a study conducted by biological anthropologists with a simple random sample of male students from a certain region with a large student population. Fingerprint patterns are generally classified as loops, whorls, and arches. The four principal blood types are designated as A, B, AB, and O. The table shows the distribution of fingerprint patterns and blood types for the sample. Expected counts are listed in parentheses. The anthropologists were interested in the possible association between the variables.

A team of psychologists studied the concept of visualization in basketball, where players visualize making a basket before shooting the ball. They conducted an experiment in which 20 basketball players with similar abilities were randomly assigned to two groups. The 10 players in group 1 received visualization training, and the 10 players in group 2 did not.

Each player stood 22 feet from the basket at the same location on the basketball court. Each player was then instructed to attempt to make the basket until two consecutive baskets were made. The players who received visualization training were instructed to use visualization techniques before attempting to make the basket. The total number of attempts, including the last two attempts, were recorded for each player.

The total number of attempts for each of the 20 players are summarized in the following boxplots.

(a) Based on the boxplots, did basketball players who received visualization training tend to need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than players who did not receive the training? Explain your reasoning.

(b) State and check conditions for conducting a two-sample \(t\)-test for a difference in means.

Because both distributions, visualization and no visualization, are skewed, the psychologists conducted a simulation to test for a difference in medians rather than means. For each trial of the simulation, the 20 values of the total number of attempts observed in the experiment were combined into one group and then randomly split into two groups of 10. The difference in the medians \((V - NV)\) of the groups was calculated for each trial. The following dotplot shows the difference in the medians for 100 trials of the simulation.

(d) Based on the \(p\)-value in part (c), is there convincing statistical evidence that basketball players similar to the ones in this study who receive visualization training need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than those who do not receive such training?

The following scatterplot shows the size, in square feet, and the selling price, in thousands of dollars, for a sample of 30 houses for sale in a certain area.

(a) Describe the association shown in the scatterplot.

(b) In the region, houses are considered large if they are greater than 2,500 square feet and expensive if the selling price is greater than $300,000. The following two-way table summarizes the houses in the sample.

(i) Use the information in the table to construct a graphical display of the data.

(ii) Assume there is no association between size (large, not large) and price (expensive, not expensive). Use the given totals to complete the following table with the expected number of houses for each classification if there was no association.

For associations displayed in the scatterplot, the strength of linear association is measured by the correlation coefficient. For the scatterplot of houses, \(r = 0.82\).

For associations that are summarized in two-way tables, the strength of association is measured by the chi-square statistic. The formula for the chi-square statistic is \(\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(\text{observed} - \text{expected})^2}{\text{expected}}\), where expected is the count assuming no association and observed is the count shown by the data. Greater values of \(\chi^2\) indicate stronger association. For the table of counts in part (b), \(\chi^2 = 10\).

(c) Suppose the selling price for the most expensive house in the sample is decreased from $489,000 to $325,000.

(i) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \(r\)? Explain your reasoning.

(ii) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \(\chi^2\)? Explain your reasoning.

(d) Based on your answer to part (c), explain one benefit and one drawback of using \(\chi^2\) rather than \(r\) to measure the strength of an association.

The movement patterns of animals are believed to be affected by their physiological states (such as hunger), predation risk, and other factors such as whether they are searching for food for their young. Optimal foraging theory predicts that foragers (animals searching for food) with a central home location should move faster the farther they are from home.

American beavers are foragers with a central home location that make foraging trips from their lodge and then return. To test the optimal foraging theory, researchers trapped and radio-tagged a random sample of 67 American beavers from the population in a certain region and recorded their movements over the course of about a year. The researchers fit a least-squares regression line to the data, where the explanatory variable was distance to lodge, in meters, and the response variable was speed, in meters per hour.

(a) Is a linear model appropriate to use for these data? Justify your response by referencing the residual plot.

(b) Identify the intercept of the least-squares regression line and interpret it in the context of the data.

(c) The researchers plan to calculate a 95 percent confidence interval for the population slope. Identify and check the conditions for the appropriate confidence interval for the population slope.

(d) The 95% confidence interval for the population slope was calculated as \((0.751, 0.947)\). Based on the confidence interval, do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that foragers with a central home location move faster the farther they are from home? Justify your response.

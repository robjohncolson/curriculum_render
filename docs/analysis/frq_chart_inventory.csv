Biologists want to estimate the number of deer living in a certain region. They will use a method known as a hair snare. A hair snare is a length of barbed wire set up near a salt lick, where deer can lick minerals and nutrients from salt deposits. The wire snares hair from the neck of the deer. The hair is collected and sent for analysis.

The biologists will randomly place 90 salt licks throughout the region. The region consists of 3 areas: the town, the forest, and the lake, as shown in the following diagram.

(a) Two methods have been proposed for choosing where to place the salt licks: a simple random sample or a stratified random sample, with area as strata. Give one reason why the stratified random sample might be the better method for choosing where to place the salt licks.

Miguel is a golfer, and he plays on the same course each week. The following table shows the probability distribution for his score on one particular hole, known as the Water Hole.

Let the random variable \(X\) represent Miguel's score on the Water Hole. In golf, lower scores are better.

(a) Suppose one of Miguel's scores from the Water Hole is selected at random. What is the probability that Miguel's score on the Water Hole is at most 5? Show your work.

(b) Calculate and interpret the expected value of \(X\). Show your work.

The name of the Water Hole comes from the small lake that lies between the tee, where the ball is first hit, and the hole. Miguel has two approaches to hitting the ball from the tee, the short hit and the long hit. The short hit results in the ball landing before the lake. The values of \(X\) in the table are based on the short hit. The long hit, if successful, results in the ball traveling over the lake and landing on the other side.

A potential issue with the long hit is that the ball might land in the water, which is not a good outcome. Miguel thinks that if the long hit is successful, his expected value improves to 4.2. However, if the long hit fails and the ball lands in the water, his expected value would be worse and increases to 5.4.

(c) Suppose the probability of a successful long hit is 0.4. Which approach, the short hit or the long hit, is better in terms of improving the expected value of the score? Justify your answer.

A fair die, with its faces numbered from 1 to 6, is one in which each number is equally likely to land face up when the die is rolled. On a fair die, the probability that the number 6 will land face up is \(\frac{1}{6}\). A group of students wanted to investigate a claim about manipulating a fair die so that it favors one outcome. The claim states that if a fair die is put into an oven and baked at 200°F for 10 minutes, the inside of the die will begin to melt. When the die cools, the inside will be solid again, but with more weight toward the bottom. This shift in weight will cause the face that was up when the die cooled to land up more often that the other faces.

The students obtained a fair die and baked it according to the preceding directions. The die cooled with the number 6 face up. After the die cooled, they rolled the die 200 times, and the number 6 landed face up 43 times. Let \(p\) represent the population proportion of times the number 6 will land face up on the baked die if the die could be rolled an infinite number of times.

(a) Clarke, one of the students, constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for \(p\) as \(0.215 \pm 0.057\). Does the interval provide convincing statistical evidence that the number 6 will land face up more often on the baked die than on a fair die? Explain your reasoning.

(b) Aurelia, another student, suggested they conduct a significance test to investigate the claim. She tested the hypotheses \(H_0: p = \frac{1}{6}\) versus \(H_a: p > \frac{1}{6}\) at the significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\). She obtained a test statistic of \(z = 1.83\) with a p-value of 0.033. Do the results of the significance test agree with the results of Clarke's confidence interval in part (a)? Explain your reasoning.

(c) Two standard normal curves are shown below, one for the confidence interval calculated in part (a) and one for the significance test conducted in part (b).

(i) For the confidence interval curve, label the critical values for the 95% confidence level and shade the area that represents values in the outer 5%.

(ii) For the significance test curve, label the critical value for the 5% significance level and shade the area representing the values of \(z\) that would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis in part (b).

(d) Joachim, a third student, noted that the confidence interval in part (a) gives plausible values of the parameter as an interval between two values. He suggested that they develop a one-sided confidence interval because they were only concerned with whether the number 6 was landing face up more often than expected, not less often. The one-sided-interval will determine a value \(L\) such that all plausible values of \(p\) are greater than \(L\). The formula for \(L\) is \(L = \hat{p} - z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\).

(i) Determine the values of \(z^*\) needed to create the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval. Then calculate the value of \(L\).

A team of psychologists studied the concept of visualization in basketball, where players visualize making a basket before shooting the ball. They conducted an experiment in which 20 basketball players with similar abilities were randomly assigned to two groups. The 10 players in group 1 received visualization training, and the 10 players in group 2 did not.

Each player stood 22 feet from the basket at the same location on the basketball court. Each player was then instructed to attempt to make the basket until two consecutive baskets were made. The players who received visualization training were instructed to use visualization techniques before attempting to make the basket. The total number of attempts, including the last two attempts, were recorded for each player.

The total number of attempts for each of the 20 players are summarized in the following boxplots.

(a) Based on the boxplots, did basketball players who received visualization training tend to need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than players who did not receive the training? Explain your reasoning.

(b) State and check conditions for conducting a two-sample \(t\)-test for a difference in means.

Because both distributions, visualization and no visualization, are skewed, the psychologists conducted a simulation to test for a difference in medians rather than means. For each trial of the simulation, the 20 values of the total number of attempts observed in the experiment were combined into one group and then randomly split into two groups of 10. The difference in the medians \((V - NV)\) of the groups was calculated for each trial. The following dotplot shows the difference in the medians for 100 trials of the simulation.

(c) Using the observed difference in medians \((V - NV)\) and the results of the simulation, estimate a \(p\)-value for a test for the difference in medians. Show the work needed to calculate this \(p\)-value.

(d) Based on the \(p\)-value in part (c), is there convincing statistical evidence that basketball players similar to the ones in this study who receive visualization training need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than those who do not receive such training? Justify your answer."

A bank categorizes its customers into one of three groups based on their banking habits. A random sample of customers from each group was selected, and the number of times each customer visited the bank during the past year was recorded. The following table shows the summary statistics.

The bank manager will investigate whether there is a significant difference in mean numbers of bank visits for the groups. Multiple two-sample \(t\)-tests will be conducted, each at the significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\).

(a) How many \(t\)-tests will need to be conducted for the manager's investigation? List the pairs of groups for each test.

The significance level (\(\alpha\)) of a single hypothesis test is the probability of making a Type I error. The manager wants to know the probability of making a Type I error for multiple \(t\)-tests, not just for a single \(t\)-test. This probability is called the family error rate for Type I error, which is also known as the family error rate.

(b) A \(t\)-test has two possible outcomes: reject or do not reject the null hypothesis. Suppose the null hypothesis is true. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the result is statistically significant, which would be a Type I error; if the null hypothesis is not rejected, the result is not statistically significant, which would not be a Type I error. Let S represent a statistically significant result, and let N represent a result that is not statistically significant.

(i) If \(P(S) = 0.05\), what is the value of \(P(N)\)?

The bank manager knows that the investigation will involve conducting multiple two-sample \(t\)-tests. The manager begins the investigation by considering two different \(t\)-tests as independent, successive trials. The possible outcomes of the trials, N or S, are shown in the following tree diagram.

(ii) The family error rate is the probability of obtaining a significant result for at least one of the \(t\)-tests conducted, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Use the tree diagram to determine the family error rate for two \(t\)-tests, each conducted at a level of \(\alpha = 0.05\). Show your work.

(c) Determine the family error rate for the number of \(t\)-tests identified in part (a), each conducted at a level of \(\alpha = 0.05\). Show your work."

The manager of the coffee shop suspects that the distribution of juice sales is different than the distribution of facings for each type of juice, so the manager records the sales of each juice over a two-week period. The proportion of facings and the sales for each type of juice are shown in the tables.

(a) Construct a single bar chart that contains both the expected proportion of sales based on the proportion of facings and the observed proportion of sales for each type of juice.

(b) Assuming the conditions for inference have been met, does the coffee shop owner have sufficient evidence to conclude that the distribution of sales is proportional to the number of facings at a 5 percent level of significance?

(a) Describe the association shown in the scatterplot.

(b) In the region, houses are considered large if they are greater than 2,500 square feet and expensive if the selling price is greater than $300,000. The following two-way table summarizes the houses in the sample.

(i) Use the information in the table to construct a graphical display of the data.

(ii) Assume there is no association between size (large, not large) and price (expensive, not expensive). Use the given totals to complete the following table with the expected number of houses for each classification if there was no association.

For associations displayed in the scatterplot, the strength of linear association is measured by the correlation coefficient. For the scatterplot of houses, \(r = 0.82\).

For associations that are summarized in two-way tables, the strength of association is measured by the chi-square statistic. The formula for the chi-square statistic is \(\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(\text{observed} - \text{expected})^2}{\text{expected}}\), where expected is the count assuming no association and observed is the count shown by the data. Greater values of \(\chi^2\) indicate stronger association. For the table of counts in part (b), \(\chi^2 = 10\).

(c) Suppose the selling price for the most expensive house in the sample is decreased from $489,000 to $325,000.

(i) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \(r\)? Explain your reasoning.

(ii) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \(\chi^2\)? Explain your reasoning.

(d) Based on your answer to part (c), explain one benefit and one drawback of using \(\chi^2\) rather than \(r\) to measure the strength of an association."

Fingerprint analysis and blood grouping are features that do not change through the lifetime of an individual. Fingerprint features appear early in the development of a fetus, and blood types are determined by genetics. Therefore, each is considered an effective tool for identification of individuals. These characteristics are also of interest in the discipline of biological anthropology—a scientific discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings.

The relationship between these characteristics was the subject of a study conducted by biological anthropologists with a simple random sample of male students from a certain region with a large student population. Fingerprint patterns are generally classified as loops, whorls, and arches. The four principal blood types are designated as A, B, AB, and O. The table shows the distribution of fingerprint patterns and blood types for the sample. Expected counts are listed in parentheses. The anthropologists were interested in the possible association between the variables.

(a) Is the test for an association in this case a chi-square test of independence, or a chi-square test of homogeneity? Justify your choice.

(b) Identify the conditions for the chi-square inference procedure selected in part (a), and indicate whether the conditions are met.

(c) The resulting chi-square test statistic from the appropriate test is approximately 18.930. What are the degrees of freedom and p-value of the test?

The movement patterns of animals are believed to be affected by their physiological states (such as hunger), predation risk, and other factors such as whether they are searching for food for their young. Optimal foraging theory predicts that foragers (animals searching for food) with a central home location should move faster the farther they are from home.

American beavers are foragers with a central home location that make foraging trips from their lodge and then return. To test the optimal foraging theory, researchers trapped and radio-tagged a random sample of 67 American beavers from the population in a certain region and recorded their movements over the course of about a year. The researchers fit a least-squares regression line to the data, where the explanatory variable was distance to lodge, in meters, and the response variable was speed, in meters per hour.

(a) Is a linear model appropriate to use for these data? Justify your response by referencing the residual plot.

(b) Identify the intercept of the least-squares regression line and interpret it in the context of the data.

(c) The researchers plan to calculate a 95 percent confidence interval for the population slope. Identify and check the conditions for the appropriate confidence interval for the population slope.

(d) The 95% confidence interval for the population slope was calculated as \((0.751, 0.947)\). Based on the confidence interval, do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that foragers with a central home location move faster the farther they are from home? Justify your response."
